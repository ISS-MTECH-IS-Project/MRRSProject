Treatment should include a water change and careful examination of the aquarium conditions. 
If there is food debris, vacuum the gravel and take care to avoid overfeeding in the future.
Start putting dates on your fish food, as it loses the vitamin content fairly quickly after the food container is opened. 
Feeding your fish fresh, high-quality food in smaller quantities is far better than frequent, large feedings of stale foods.
Check the pH and temperature of the water, and make sure it is appropriate for your fish species.
 Be sure there is no chlorine, ammonia, or nitrite in the water and the nitrate is under 40 ppm (mg/L).

Columnaris can enter the fish through the gills, mouth, or via small wounds on the skin. 
The disease is highly contagious and may be spread through contaminated nets, specimen containers, and even food. 
For this reason, it is important to use sterile techniques to avoid contaminating other tanks.
Prophylactic treatment of all other tanks is wise and is mandatory if they share a common filtration system.​

Consequently, any fish may be exposed to the dropsy-causing bacteria, but healthy fish rarely fall prey to the disease. 
Fish are only susceptible when their immune system has been compromised by some other stress factor, such as:
Poor water quality
Ammonia or nitrite spikes
A large drop in water temperature
Stress from transportation
Improper nutrition
Aggressive tankmates
Other diseases
The agent that causes the symptoms of dropsy is usually the very common Aeromonas bacteria, one of several gram-negative bacteria present in most aquarium habitats. 
The bacteria will only lead to serious infection in a fish that already has a compromised immune system.","The infection-causing dropsy is not easily cured. 
Some experts recommend that all affected fish be euthanized to prevent the spread of the infection to healthy fish. 
Also, when combined with popeye, the prognosis is bleak. 
However, if the infection is detected early and the fish are isolated for proper treatment, it is possible to save the affected fish. 
Treatment is geared toward correcting the underlying problem and providing supportive care to the sick fish in a ""hospital tank.""
Salt should be added to the hospital tank, again at the ratio of 1 teaspoon per gallon of water. 
Low levels of salt in the water aid in the osmotic balance of the fish by making the water salinity closer to the fish's blood salinity. 
That helps the fish get rid of excess water accumulating in the body, causing dropsy. 
Provide the ill fish with a variety of fresh, high-quality food.

7,Popeye,Exophthalmia,ALL,,Eyes protruding,Cloudy white or greyish eyes,Bloodstained eye,Ruptured eye,Loss of vision,Lethargic behavior,,,,,,,"Most commonly, fish popeye is caused by an injury, an infection, or poor water conditions in the aquarium.
If only one eye is affected (unilateral), it is likely that the condition is caused by an injury rather than a problem with the water chemistry. 
This is particularly true if only one fish in a community tank is exhibiting popeye. 
A swollen eye can be the outcome of a fight with another fish, or your fish could have scraped its eye against an abrasive object in the tank. 
If this happens, look for damage to the eye—a dead giveaway that exophthalmia is the result of an injury. 
In most injuries, the protruding eye will eventually recede as it heals.
However, the fish should be monitored closely, as infection can ensue, causing the fish to lose sight in the affected eye.
Another cause of popeye is an infection.
This is most likely seen in both eyes. 
Infection may be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and parasites. 
If the fish suffers from both popeye and dropsy (edema of the belly), the prognosis is bleak. 
Internal problems, such as kidney failure or a metabolic issue can result in fluid build-up, making it extremely hard to treat your fish.
Poor water conditions can also contribute to popeye and fish that are sensitive will be affected first. 
If one or more fish in your tank presents with popeye, test your water to determine if something is amiss with its chemistry. 
Also consider supersaturation of gas in the water, which can be seen as tiny bubbles on the sides of the aquarium and even in the fish's skin. 
This can cause gas to accumulate in the eyes and make them swell","Treatment for popeye will depend upon the underlying cause. 
If the eye has been injured, it will typically heal on its own, as long as the fish does not develop a secondary infection or become stressed. 
You can help the fish recover by performing palliative care using aquarium salt while the eye heals (unless contraindicated). 
This helps to relieve the swelling. 
You should also remove any tank decorations that might contribute to further injuries, such as rough or sharp rocks, pointed plants, and decorative items with rough or pointed edges.

Regular water changes and the monitoring of water chemistry are also recommended throughout the recovery time, as poor water condition is a common cause of popeye, as well as other fish ailments. 
If water tests indicate a problem—a drifting pH or elevated ammonia or nitrite—correct it promptly to avoid additional stress

Any fish clearly suffering from a bacterial infection should be moved to a quarantine tank to avoid infecting other fish. 
Treat this fish with a broad-spectrum antibiotic recommended by your pet supplier or veterinarian to resolve the infection. 
If more than one fish is infected, it may be necessary to treat the main tank with antibiotics, as well.

8,Swim Bladder Disease,Swim Bladder Disorder,ALL,,Bloated abdomen or belly,Curved spine,Swimming difficulty,Upside down,Erratic swimming,Swimming with heavy head,Gasping at the surface,Spend time on surface,,,,,"This disorder can be caused by many issues, spanning from environment to feeding problems, including the following:
Rapidly eating, overeating, constipation, or gulping air may occur with floating foods to cause an extended belly and displace the swim bladder. 
Eating freeze-dried or dry flake food that expands when it becomes wet can also lead to an enlarged stomach or intestinal tract.
Other abdominal organs may become enlarged and affect the swim bladder. 
Cysts in the kidneys, fatty deposits in the liver, or egg binding in female fish can result in sufficient enlargement to affect the swim bladder.
Low water temperature can slow the digestive process, which in turn can result in gastrointestinal tract enlargement that puts pressure on the swim bladder.
Parasites or bacterial infections can inflame the swim bladder as well.
Occasionally a hard blow from striking an object in the tank, a fight, or fall can damage the swim bladder.
Rarely fish are born with birth defects that affect the swim bladder, but in these cases, symptoms are usually present at an early age.","Treatment involves water maintenance, feeding changes, and possible antibiotics.
Let the fish fast: If an enlarged stomach or intestine is thought to be the cause of a swim bladder disorder, the first course of action is to not feed the fish for three days.
Fix the water temperature: At the same time the fish is fasting, increase the water temperature to 78-80 degrees Fahrenheit and leave it there during treatment.
Feed the fish peas: On the fourth day, feed the fish a cooked and skinned pea. 
Frozen peas are ideal for this, as they can be microwaved or boiled for a few seconds to thaw them, resulting in the proper consistency (not too soft but not too firm).
Antibiotics: If an infection is thought to be the cause of a fish's swim bladder disorder, treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic may help, and for this, you'll need to visit your veterinarian.
Other supportive treatments (regardless of the cause) can include the following:
Keep the water especially clean and temperatures between 78 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.
Add a small amount of aquarium salt to the tank.
Reduce the water level to make it easier for the fish to move around within the tank.
Reduce water flow in tanks with a strong current.

In marine fish, Amyloödinium ocellatum causes the dreaded Coral Fish Disease. 
All three species have symptoms and life cycles similar to the well-known ciliated protozoan parasite, Ich.
Like Ich, Oödinium may be present in most commercial aquariums, but only becomes a problem when the fish are stressed by poor quality water, changes in the water temperature, or being transported.","Raise water temperature
Dim lights for several days
Add aquarium salt
Treat with copper sulfate for ten days
Discontinue carbon filtration during treatment
Because Velvet is highly contagious and usually far advanced before being diagnosed, it is important to take steps to treat it as soon as possible.
Treatment is targeted at the free-swimming stage (tomite) of the parasite.
Copper sulfate is the treatment of choice.
It should be used according to the manufacturer’s instructions for a full ten days to ensure that the parasite is completely eradicated. 
Atabrine (quinacrine hydrochloride) is another medication that can be used to treat Velvet.
Because Oödinium is also photosynthetic, dimming the aquarium lights aids in eliminating the infestation. Increasing the water temperature to 82 degrees F will speed the life cycle of the parasite, making it faster to treat and infestation. 
Adding salt to the water (1 to 3 level teaspoons per gallon of water) will increase the mucus production of the fish to help deter the parasite and will reduce the osmotic stress in the water.

10,Ammonia Poisoning,Nitrite poisoning,ALL,,Gasping at the surface,Red or inflamed gill,,,,,,,,,,,"Ammonia can enter the tank through a number of different ways. 
The first way is through chemically treated tap water. 
Overfeeding and lack of cleaning add to a buildup of the bacteria that feed on this superfluous matter, resulting in an ammonia byproduct. 
Fish, themselves, also contribute to rising ammonia levels in tanks. 
When a fish eats food, the protein-building process that ensues (in order for them to grow larger) can produce a byproduct that enters their blood. 
This results in the seepage of ammonia through their gills and into the tank.","If the ammonia level in your tank rises above 1 ppm (part per million) on a standard test kit, begin treatment immediately. 
Lowering the pH of the water will provide immediate relief, as will a 50 percent water change (be sure the water added is the same temperature as the aquarium). 
Several water changes within a short period of time may be required to drop the ammonia below 1 ppm.
If the fish appear to be severely distressed, use a chemical pH control product to neutralize the ammonia. 
At this point, restrict feedings so that additional waste is reduced. 
In cases of very high ammonia levels, feedings need to be discontinued for several days.

They are commonly found on koi and goldfish, but can be found on many freshwater fish species. 
The ""worm"" part extending out into the water is actually the female reproductive structures.
Anchor worms occur when a new fish is added to an aquarium carrying juvenile anchor worms or a reproductively-active female in their skin. 
Skipping proper quarantine makes this parasite spread very rapidly. 
A single female anchor worm can produce hundreds of larvae every two weeks for up to 16 weeks in a 77F (25C) tank.
Anchor worm juveniles can also be spread with the introduction of live plants. 
Aquatic plants can bring parasites like anchor worm into your aquarium if not properly quarantined.","Anchor worms need to be removed correctly with a fish under sedation by your veterinarian. 
They will need to remove the entire parasite including the feeding end from under the fish’s skin. 
Depending on the level of infestation, sedation makes the process less stressful for the fish and allows the veterinarian to work more effectively without a squirming fish.
Once the mature females have been removed, you may still have a microscopic problem: the juvenile stages. 
Over-the-counter ""anchor worm"" treatments are usually fairly effective against the juvenile stages, but they will not kill the adults. 
Another way of killing the free-swimming juvenile stage in the aquarium can be accomplished by removing your substrate and decor and running your water through a UV light.
Treating anchor worms with organophosphates or diflubenzuron (dimilin) is effective, but needs to be undertaken with severe caution. 
Only use veterinary-approved products, keep them away from your other pets and children, and make sure to wear proper protection (i.e., gloves) when handling medications.

They then start to defecate their mucosal gut lining, leading to a milky, transparent poop and a constipation misdiagnosis.
Temperature changes can cause bloating or blockages. 
The metabolisms of temperate fish are temperature driven, and as things cool their gut flora becomes less efficient, causing slow digestion.
Internal tumours may press against the stomach or intestine, making it difficult to pass food through.
Physical deformities, such as those in Balloon fish or goldfish, cause organs to be displaced or press against each other.
Physical blockages occur in ‘grubbing’ fish like goldfish, which have evolved to take in mouthfuls of sand, silt and mud. 
When placed into a tank with pea gravel, it may be swallowed, blocking the oesophagus.
Physical blockages will require a vet, as it is likely you’ll damage the fish trying to remove any obstruction. 
Incorrect diet is a major player. While many fish are extremely versatile in their eating habits, some foods simply do not suit some fish.
Surface feeding plays a role, especially in goldfish. Goldfish are phyostomous, with a duct between the swim bladder and the oesophagus, for the purpose of getting air into the swim bladder.
When goldfish feed on floating flakes or pellets, they are prone to swallowing down gulps of air with them. Once inside them, it not only interferes with digestion but also causes buoyancy issues.
Stale or spoiled dry food is also a common issue.
Lack of fibre is something that can cause constipation, but not with any particular regularity, and almost always only in tandem with offering improper diet or stale foods.","One of the easiest ways to treat a constipated fish is to increase the amount of fiber in their diet and if necessary, deworm your fish.

Asymptomatic carriers may be present in your system and never show any clinical signs, so identifying a virus-positive fish can be difficult.
The virus is often self-limiting, but may take weeks to resolve with supportive care. 
Try to be patient and provide good water quality and a proper diet as your fish recovers. 
You can move them to a quarantine system, but the virus will already have spread around your tank once a fish shows clinical signs",FALSE,,,,,,,,

If they were bred in an overstocked aquarium or fish farm, the likelihood of fish having parasites is fairly high due to poor water quality. 
Always quarantine new fish for several days prior to putting them in your pond, and observe them for any signs or symptoms of gill maggots or other parasites.
Additionally, larval gill maggots can be transported from live food. 
If you purchase live food, such as bloodworms, tiny shrimps, etcetera, for your fish, be sure to only purchase them from a reputable and trustworthy source, and check them very thoroughly for any parasites.","Current treatments for Ergasilus include trichlorfon, or mixture of copper sulfate and ferric sulfate.

The nematode thrives in mostly dull and cloudy water. 
They are rarely found in clean water in an aquarium with proper filtration systems.
Some nematodes can be transmitted directly from fish to fish.","Prior to administration of deworming medications (anthelminthic), the problem should be properly diagnosed by a vet. 
After verification of infection, alternative therapies can be discussed.
For intestinal nematode infections of ornamental fish, several anthelminthics (dewormers) are available. 
Two effective and commonly used dewormers are fenbendazole and levamisole. 
Fenbendazole can only be used as a feed additive at the rate of 1.14 grams per pound of food fed for three days, with a repeat treatment in two to three weeks. 
Levamisole can be used both in the feed and as a bath treatment. One effective oral dose is 1.8 grams of levamisole per pound of food fed once a week for three weeks. 
Control of nematodes that infect areas of the fish other than the gastrointestinal tract is more problematic. 
In fact, surgical removal is the only way to rid fish of internal worms that are not found in the intestine.

Formalin has bactericidal properties, but its efficacy has never been studied specifically against chilodonellosis. 
Limited information exists about formalin bioaccumulation in fish and the potential implications for human health are unknown.

Like other herpes viruses, the virus has a latent or carrier state that persists within an individual without showing any external clinical signs. 
Fish can be infected very young in life and may not show clinical signs until years later. 
Secondary stress can activate latent infections and cause skin lesions and infect other fish through direct contact or water-borne transmission.


Once a fish has been diagnosed with carp pox in your pond, it is assumed that all the other fish in the pond are potential carriers. In an infected pond, it is rare for more than one or two fish to show clinical signs at once, unless many potential stressors, such as poor water quality, are present.

It has been demonstrated that goldfish, Carassius auratus, can carry Koi Herpes Virus2, so there is the potential that they can also carry carp pox. Goldfish will not show the symptoms of KHV when they are carriers, so it possible they can also carry carp pox between infected systems without showing clinical signs.","Like all other herpes viruses, latent virions will bury deep into neural tissue, making them impossible to remove or treat. 
As for any species, herpes is for life. 
There is no treatment available at this time. 
Surgical removal of the plaques is not recommended since they will only grow back.

There are so many different species that every freshwater fish is susceptible to some Saprolegnia species. 
Typically, water molds feed on dead organic materials and replicate by forming spores. 
These spores seed a substrate and float about, waiting for a bit of dead tissue to inhabit and grow into. 
Dead skin cells on fish with injuries or weakened immune systems make ideal hosts.
Saprolegnia is an opportunistic pathogen that will likely infect fishes that are living poor water quality, wrong temperatures (eg tropical fishes in cold water) or are immunosuppressed by other infections or even high stress.","It is imperative that Saprolegnia be properly diagnosed by an aquatic veterinarian prior to treatment. 
Water mold can look very similar to Columnaris bacteria and will require a completely different treatment. 
Your vet will do a skin mucus scrape or swab culture to determine the problematic pathogen.
Since it is a water mold, it is not responsive to antibiotics. 
However, there may be a bacterial infection that caused the fish to be weak initially, allowing the Saprolegnia to grow on it. 
You may need to treat for both bacterial infections and the Saprolegnia fungus, using different medications.

This causes Saltwater Ich to exist in the holding tanks of fish wholesalers and distributors.  The parasites will then make their way to your local pet store and from there they will enter your home aquarium.,"Quarantine all fish, coral and invertebrates for at least 45 to 90 days or preventive medicine treatment could mitigate the risk of Saltwater Ich outbreaks. 
The two most proven and effective treatments for Marine Ich are Chloroquine Phosphate and Copper Sulfate based medications. CP or pharmaceutical grade Chloroquine Phosphate requires a prescription from a veterinarian, so this leads most hobbyists to use copper treatments. The CP that is available online from eBay and other websites is rarely medical grade and not worth the risk to your fish.
Copper is a poison and has been compared to chemotherapy for fish. It is often deadly to fish at unregulated levels or if a fish is too weak when the treatment begins. Purchasing a reliable copper test kit is absolutely required if you intend to use any copper medications on your fish.
Cupramine from Seachem is a very popular choice that contains ionic copper. Cupramine has the advantage of mixing much easier into the water than some other products. The Cupramine therapeutic level is 0.50 ppm and should only be read with the Seachem or Salifert copper test kit.
Prime, Amguard or other ammonia binding products should be avoided while using Cupramine because they have been reported to increase the mortality rate of fish during treatment.
Coppersafe is a much older liquid option that contains chelated copper with a therapeutic level between 1.5 – 2.0 ppm. The API test kit is recommended for this treatment and you are able to use ammonia binding products. However, there are reports that it less effective than some other options.
Cuprion from Brightwell Aquatics is another ionic copper liquid-based treatment. The therapeutic level is 0.20 ppm. Seachem or Salifert copper test kit is recommended again for this product and ammonia binders should be avoided.
Copper Power Blue is advertised as the safest treatment for Saltwater Ich. The therapeutic level between 1.5 – 2.0 ppm for Copper Power, but they claim 2.5ppm is also safe.

In marine fish, Amyloödinium ocellatum causes the dreaded Coral Fish Disease. 
All three species have symptoms and life cycles similar to the well-known ciliated protozoan parasite, Ich.
Like Ich, Oödinium may be present in most commercial aquariums, but only becomes a problem when the fish are stressed by poor quality water, changes in the water temperature, or being transported.","Chloroquine phosphate is the treatment of choice for velvet, but copper also works if symptoms are caught early on. 
Tank transfer and hyposalinity do not work with velvet. 
A freshwater dip and/or chemical bath (discussed in more detail below) is recommended either before or during treatment, due to the severity of this disease; however these would only provide temporary relief and will not eradicate velvet.Tank fallow period of 6 weeks is advisable.Formalin – Cheap, effective and readily available; formalin can sometimes even be sourced from a vet or local pharmacy (37% Formaldehyde is what you’re looking for). However, the downsides are numerous: First, it can be very harsh – some fish cannot even survive in it the full 60 minutes. Formalin will quickly deplete oxygen from the water, so it’s important to aerate heavily for 30 minutes before and also during the bath treatment. The bath should be done in a large glass bowl/container or small aquarium, as plastic may absorb some of the medication and then leach it back out during future use. Finally, formalin is a known carcinogen, so precautions must be taken when handling it. Prevent your skin from coming into contact with it by wearing waterproof gloves, and protect your face by wearing a face mask and eye protection.
Acriflavine –  It has a broad range of effect, being effective against both protozoans and bacterial infections. The latter gives it an advantage over using formalin, because all those tiny bite marks inflicted by velvet have the potential to get infected. You can also leave a fish in acriflavine longer than formalin, because it is not as harsh on the fish. Dosage varies by the product you are using, but for straight acriflavine (Acriflavine-MS) use 1 teaspoon per 5 gallons of water for a bath solution.
Methylene Blue – May be added to the formalin bath only. It is a healing agent, useful for treating the tiny bite marks inflicted by velvet.
Chloroquine phosphate/copper – While all of the above will remove the vast majority of velvet on a fish, some will inevitably survive. Within 4 days the remaining trophonts will drop off the fish, then encyst, and usually 48-96 hours later (although it can take up to 20+ days depending upon the strain) release dinospores (free swimmers) seeking to reinfect fish. The presence of CP or copper at therapeutic levels kills the dinospores, effectively shielding your fish from reinfection. It is important to note that CP/copper does not eradicate any other stage of velvet, just dinospores. It has zero impact on the parasites on the fish; they must “weather the storm” until the trophonts fall off. This is why it is so important to do a freshwater dip and chemical bath beforehand, to reduce the number of parasites feeding on your fish’s body & gills.
Wide spectrum antibiotic – Velvet does A LOT of damage to a fish’s skin & gills. The trophont sits on the skin’s surface and puts out small rhyzoids (root-like structures) into the skin of the host where it absorbs nutrients directly from the fish’s skin. With all those tiny wounds, the likelihood of infection is high. This is something I missed in my earlier experiments where the fish died. Therefore, I consider it prudent to preemptively treat withKanaplex and/or Furan-2 to ward off any potential bacterial infections which might arise.",,Chloroquine Phosphate,Formalin,Acriflavine,Methylene Blue,Copper,Antibiotics,,
