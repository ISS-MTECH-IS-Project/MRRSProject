      "If only one eye is affected (unilateral), it is likely that the condition is caused by an injury rather than a problem with the water chemistry. \n",
      "This is particularly true if only one fish in a community tank is exhibiting popeye. \n",

      "Poor water conditions can also contribute to popeye and fish that are sensitive will be affected first. \n",
      "If one or more fish in your tank presents with popeye, test your water to determine if something is amiss with its chemistry. \n",

      "This can cause gas to accumulate in the eyes and make them swell\n",
      "treatment - Treatment for popeye will depend upon the underlying cause. \n",
      "If the eye has been injured, it will typically heal on its own, as long as the fish does not develop a secondary infection or become stressed. \n",

      "Fix the water temperature: At the same time the fish is fasting, increase the water temperature to 78-80 degrees Fahrenheit and leave it there during treatment.\n",
      "Feed the fish peas: On the fourth day, feed the fish a cooked and skinned pea. \n",
      "Frozen peas are ideal for this, as they can be microwaved or boiled for a few seconds to thaw them, resulting in the proper consistency (not too soft but not too firm).\n",
      "Antibiotics: If an infection is thought to be the cause of a fish's swim bladder disorder, treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic may help, and for this, you'll need to visit your veterinarian.\n",

      "Keep the water especially clean and temperatures between 78 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\n",

The CP that is available online from eBay and other websites is rarely medical grade and not worth the risk to your fish.\n",
      "Copper is a poison and has been compared to chemotherapy for fish. It is often deadly to fish at unregulated levels or if a fish is too weak when the treatment begins. Purchasing a reliable copper test kit is absolutely required if you intend to use any copper medications on your fish.\n",
      "Cupramine from Seachem is a very popular choice that contains ionic copper. Cupramine has the advantage of mixing much easier into the water than some other products. The Cupramine therapeutic level is 0.50 ppm and should only be read with the Seachem or Salifert copper test kit.\n",
      "Prime, Amguard or other ammonia binding products should be avoided while using Cupramine because they have been reported to increase the mortality rate of fish during treatment.\n",
      "Coppersafe is a much older liquid option that contains chelated copper with a therapeutic level between 1.5 â 2.0 ppm. The API test kit is recommended for this treatment and you are able to use ammonia binding products. However, there are reports that it less effective than some other options.\n",
      "Cuprion from Brightwell Aquatics is another ionic copper liquid-based treatment. The therapeutic level is 0.20 ppm. Seachem or Salifert copper test kit is recommended again for this product and ammonia binders should be avoided.\n",
      "Copper Power Blue is advertised as the safest treatment for Saltwater Ich. The therapeutic level between 1.5 â 2.0 ppm for Copper Power, but they claim 2.5ppm is also safe. The API test kit is recommended for monitoring this product.\n",

      "Set props on Disease-Marine Velvet Disease:\n",
      "environment - Saltwater\n",
      "affectfish - nan\n",
      "cause - In freshwater fish, Velvet is caused by either OÃ¶dinium pillularis or OÃ¶dinium limneticum. \n",
      "In marine fish, AmyloÃ¶dinium ocellatum causes the dreaded Coral Fish Disease. \n",
      "All three species have symptoms and life cycles similar to the well-known ciliated protozoan parasite, Ich.\n",
      "Like Ich, OÃ¶dinium may be present in most commercial aquariums, but only becomes a problem when the fish are stressed by poor quality water, changes in the water temperature, or being transported.\n",
      "treatment - Chloroquine phosphate is the treatment of choice for velvet, but copper also works if symptoms are caught early on. \n",
      "Tank transfer and hyposalinity do not work with velvet. \n",
      "A freshwater dip and/or chemical bath (discussed in more detail below) is recommended either before or during treatment, due to the severity of this disease; however these would only provide temporary relief and will not eradicate velvet.Tank fallow period of 6 weeks is advisable.Formalin â Cheap, effective and readily available; formalin can sometimes even be sourced from a vet or local pharmacy (37% Formaldehyde is what youâre looking for). However, the downsides are numerous: First, it can be very harsh â some fish cannot even survive in it the full 60 minutes. Formalin will quickly deplete oxygen from the water, so itâs important to aerate heavily for 30 minutes before and also during the bath treatment. The bath should be done in a large glass bowl/container or small aquarium, as plastic may absorb some of the medication and then leach it back out during future use. Finally, formalin is a known carcinogen, so precautions must be taken when handling it. Prevent your skin from coming into contact with it by wearing waterproof gloves, and protect your face by wearing a face mask and eye protection.\n",
      "Acriflavine â  It has a broad range of effect, being effective against both protozoans and bacterial infections. The latter gives it an advantage over using formalin, because all those tiny bite marks inflicted by velvet have the potential to get infected. You can also leave a fish in acriflavine longer than formalin, because it is not as harsh on the fish. Dosage varies by the product you are using, but for straight acriflavine (Acriflavine-MS) use 1 teaspoon per 5 gallons of water for a bath solution.\n",
      "Methylene Blue â May be added to the formalin bath only. It is a healing agent, useful for treating the tiny bite marks inflicted by velvet.\n",
      "Chloroquine phosphate/copper â While all of the above will remove the vast majority of velvet on a fish, some will inevitably survive. Within 4 days the remaining trophonts will drop off the fish, then encyst, and usually 48-96 hours later (although it can take up to 20+ days depending upon the strain) release dinospores (free swimmers) seeking to reinfect fish. The presence of CP or copper at therapeutic levels kills the dinospores, effectively shielding your fish from reinfection. It is important to note that CP/copper does not eradicate any other stage of velvet, just dinospores. It has zero impact on the parasites on the fish; they must âweather the stormâ until the trophonts fall off. This is why it is so important to do a freshwater dip and chemical bath beforehand, to reduce the number of parasites feeding on your fishâs body & gills.\n",
      "Wide spectrum antibiotic â Velvet does A LOT of damage to a fishâs skin & gills. The trophont sits on the skinâs surface and puts out small rhyzoids (root-like structures) into the skin of the host where it absorbs nutrients directly from the fishâs skin. With all those tiny wounds, the likelihood of infection is high. This is something I missed in my earlier experiments where the fish died. Therefore, I consider it prudent to preemptively treat withKanaplex and/or Furan-2 to ward off any potential bacterial infections which might arise.\n",
