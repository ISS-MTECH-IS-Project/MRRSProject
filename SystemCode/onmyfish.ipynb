      "This is particularly true if only one fish in a community tank is exhibiting popeye. \n",

      "Tank transfer and hyposalinity do not work with velvet. \n",
      "A freshwater dip and/or chemical bath (discussed in more detail below) is recommended either before or during treatment, due to the severity of this disease; however these would only provide temporary relief and will not eradicate velvet.Tank fallow period of 6 weeks is advisable.Formalin â Cheap, effective and readily available; formalin can sometimes even be sourced from a vet or local pharmacy (37% Formaldehyde is what youâre looking for). However, the downsides are numerous: First, it can be very harsh â some fish cannot even survive in it the full 60 minutes. Formalin will quickly deplete oxygen from the water, so itâs important to aerate heavily for 30 minutes before and also during the bath treatment. The bath should be done in a large glass bowl/container or small aquarium, as plastic may absorb some of the medication and then leach it back out during future use. Finally, formalin is a known carcinogen, so precautions must be taken when handling it. Prevent your skin from coming into contact with it by wearing waterproof gloves, and protect your face by wearing a face mask and eye protection.\n",
      "Acriflavine â  It has a broad range of effect, being effective against both protozoans and bacterial infections. The latter gives it an advantage over using formalin, because all those tiny bite marks inflicted by velvet have the potential to get infected. You can also leave a fish in acriflavine longer than formalin, because it is not as harsh on the fish. Dosage varies by the product you are using, but for straight acriflavine (Acriflavine-MS) use 1 teaspoon per 5 gallons of water for a bath solution.\n",
      "Methylene Blue â May be added to the formalin bath only. It is a healing agent, useful for treating the tiny bite marks inflicted by velvet.\n",
      "Chloroquine phosphate/copper â While all of the above will remove the vast majority of velvet on a fish, some will inevitably survive. Within 4 days the remaining trophonts will drop off the fish, then encyst, and usually 48-96 hours later (although it can take up to 20+ days depending upon the strain) release dinospores (free swimmers) seeking to reinfect fish. The presence of CP or copper at therapeutic levels kills the dinospores, effectively shielding your fish from reinfection. It is important to note that CP/copper does not eradicate any other stage of velvet, just dinospores. It has zero impact on the parasites on the fish; they must âweather the stormâ until the trophonts fall off. This is why it is so important to do a freshwater dip and chemical bath beforehand, to reduce the number of parasites feeding on your fishâs body & gills.\n",
      "Wide spectrum antibiotic â Velvet does A LOT of damage to a fishâs skin & gills. The trophont sits on the skinâs surface and puts out small rhyzoids (root-like structures) into the skin of the host where it absorbs nutrients directly from the fishâs skin. With all those tiny wounds, the likelihood of infection is high. This is something I missed in my earlier experiments where the fish died. Therefore, I consider it prudent to preemptively treat withKanaplex and/or Furan-2 to ward off any potential bacterial infections which might arise.\n",
